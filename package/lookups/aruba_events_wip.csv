"500002","Mobile IP handles all the frames from a station until it gets assigned a mobility state. This message means that we have exceeded the number of received frames threshold before assigning a mobility state. This threshold is configurable with the ip mobile proxy event-threshold command. Cause: This means that either there is an unexpected problem with mobility state for this station or that this station generates a lot of upstream frames at a high rate shortly after association. Recommended Action: Since client exceeded threshold it will be penalized for 60 seconds during which mobility will not process any event from client. During this period client will experience connectivity issues.”

"500004","Created mobility state for the station. This state will be kept as long as the station will be active on this switch or roaming. This state holds the station mobility state.
"500006","When a station cannot be provided with mobility service, we add a temporary bridge entry in the data path for this station so that it can get service without mobility. This message means that this entry will be deleted. Recommended Action: The mobility status of this station will be evaluated again on the frame we receive from it and it may either get mobility service if the situation was corrected of another temporary bridge entry.
"500007","When a station enter stale state (due to 802.11 Disassociation, HA went down etc) a configurable timer is started which deletes the client upon its expiry. This is an intermediate state used to hold client until we hear from it again.
"500008","When a station uses Stale IP address (that may happen due to network topology change e.g. HA went down and FA does not have access to client Home network or a AP failover happened client's IP address is no longer valid in new environment) it goes to “”No mobility service state”” where it gets add a temporary bridge entry in the data path. Recommended Action: As soon as mobility detects station is using stale IP it starts De-auth timer and before its expiry if client didn't recovered on its own(get new IP) it is De-authenticated to force renew its IP address that fits in new environment.”
"500009","When mobility state machine does not receive ack from auth module; this timer fires which terminates mobility service of user in an effort to start a brand new state machine

"500070","No VLAN can be found matching the IP address that the station is currently using. Cause: This may be because the station was previously in another network or because the Home Agent Table for the mobility domain is not properly configured.
"500072","The station IP address seems to belong to any VLAN or match any HAT entry. Cause: This may mean that the HAT for the mobility domain is misconfigured or that the station previously joined another network.
"500073","When a new station associates to a switch, we perform HA discovery to find out if this station has an ongoing session on any of the switches that matches the station IP in the HAT. This means that no remote switch had a session, so this switch will become the home switch for the station”

"500075","Proxy DHCP might require to handle DHCP packets from the client before mobility state is set for the station. Recommended Action: When this happens, HA discovery has to be started.”
"500076","Proxy DHCP might require to handle DHCP packets from the client before mobility state is set for the station. Recommended Action: This message meant that HA discovery is in progress and until HA is located all frames will be dropped.
"500077","When a station associates with a switch and we have no prior mobility state for this station, we look at the station IP address to locate its HA. The lookup is performed in the active HAT (Home Agent Table), which is the aggregation of all the HATs of the active mobility domains on a switch. This message means that no matching entry was found in the HAT for this station. Cause: This maybe because the station has recently joined another network and is requesting an address from that network in DHCP. Or if this address is part of the Enterprise WLAN, it may mean that a subnet is missing from the HAT configuration.
